## Conclusion

![Understanding Flexbox - conclusion](http://i.imgur.com/PVgFYV2.jpg)

You've learned how to use the Flex-container and flex-item alignment properties. I walked you through an understanding of absolute and relative flex, auto-margin alignments and switching flex direction. You had a chance to apply your flex skills to building Catty Music and then I touched up on responsive design.

It's been a long ride indeed. Now, I'll explain some final concepts to you, help you with resources and links I think you'll find very helpful.

## How's the browser support for flexbox?

This is a common question asked when looking to use the flexbox model in production. I can't answer the question perfectly, but the [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/) website does justice to this.

Here's a screenshot from caniuse, and browser support is quite impressive. You may see for yourself [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox).

Early in my career, I glanced over caniuse many times and still could not grasp what the data represented meant.
So here's a brief explanation. At the right bottom of the caniuse website is a legend. Take a look at the image above, or just visit the site, find the legend and you'd be good to go. That's actually all there is to it.
