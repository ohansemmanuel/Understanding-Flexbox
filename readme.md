The title, _"Understanding Flexbox: Everything you need to know,"_ may seem messed up. No one can fit everything there is to a subject within one article, and even if such person existed, it isn't me.

Still, I'd take on the challenge to discuss "everything" you need to get good with the CSS Flexbox model. I hope you're ready for it.


### The Learning Curve 

Here is a tweet from [Philip Roberts](https://andyet.com/team/phil/), someone I respect.

Learning Flexbox may not begin as fun at first. It challenges what you've known about layouts in CSS. But that's fine. Everything worth learning begins that way. Flexbox is certainly something you should take seriously. It paves the way for the modern style of laying out content, and it's not going away any time soon.
Flexbox is a big player in this new standard. So with outstretched arms, embrace it!


### What you'll Learn
I'll first walk you through the basics of Flexbox. I believe any attempt at understanding Flexbox must begin here

Learning the fundamentals is cool. What's even cooler is applying this knowledge to real world use. Other than the many small things you'll build, I'll wrap things up with walking you through building this music app layout completely done with Flexbox.

Doesn't that look pretty? I believe you'd get to understand the inner workings of Flexbox better after working through that. Oh, you'd also see how all these play out in responsive design too.

I'm pretty much excited to show all this to you

I wouldn't start off with just building stuffs. There's going to be some boring drilling first. You may not like that, but it's all in the process of making you adept at Flexbox. Let's get started!
